- ! - Rewrote player handling from the ground up -.- Bugs incoming, needs deep testing
- Tweaked Shadow Form to last 2s instead of 0s, to prevent lag-flickering client side. (when client lagged, it didn't reapply invis immediatly and waited for server to reapply it, making player visible for a couple ms >1000ms latency still behaves this way)
